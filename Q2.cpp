/* Q2 - There is a man going on a trek. The trek consists of n + 1 points at different altitudes. The
man starts his trek on point 0 with altitude equal 0. You are given an integer array height
of length n where height[i] is the net height in altitude between points i and i + 1 for all
(0 <= i < n). Return the highest altitude of a point

Input: height=[-4,1,6,0,-8]
Output: 3
Explanation: The man starts at 0 and since then the altitudes covered will be [0,-4,-3,3,3,-5] so
the greatest altitude will be  */
