/* Q5 - Given an array containing n distinct integers in the range [0,n] (inclusive of both 0 and n) (inclusive of
both 0 and n). Find and return the only number of the range that is not present in the array. Here 1<n<101.
 
Ex: arr=[3,0,1] 
Output: 2
n=3, thus the range will be [0,3]
Ex: arr=[8,6,4,2,3,5,0,1]
Output: 7
n=8, thus the range will be [0,8]      */
